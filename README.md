This VS Code project implements a simulator of the CHASM computer architecture. It is written in C with a very restrained amount of C++.

## About CHASM

CHASM's purpose is to provide a starting platform for the LETHE hobbyist operating system, and more generally to bootstrap microkernel-based systems being developed from scratch without using an off-the-shelf compiler toolchain. Like most real-world CPUs, CHASM is a von Neumann machine with a register-based architecture. It uses 16-bit instruction words and memory addresses with 64-bit registers, and has a feature set somewhere between the MIPS and m68k ISAs. In interms of complexity it is best described as RISC-like.

See http://lethe.rhetori.ca/chasm-spec.txt for a description of the CHASM CPU and related hardware, including the full assembly language used by the CHAS assembler.


## Usage

CHASM requires SDL3. On Windows, you will need MSYS64 to compile it.

Hint: `cmake -S src build; cmake --build build` in the project's root directory.

The syntax is:

	`chasm [--v|--narrative] [--rom <filename>]`

	`--v`: Enable verbose mode.
	`--narrative`: Enable EXTREMELY verbose mode.
	`--rom <filename>`: Path to the ROM file. This is a raw binary generated by CHAS. It should be 240 KiB and compiled with the base address of 0x3000.


## The CHAS assembly language

See https://github.com/rhetorica/chas for the assembler.


## Lethe

CHASM is a component of the LETHE hobbyist operating system project. Read more at http://lethe.rhetori.ca/
